## Hi there I'm Pratik & This is LinkFree ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**pratik23rj/pratik23rj** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


### LinkFree - A free and open source alternative to LinkTree!
   What is LinkFree? Ever wanted to add more links to your Instagram bio? LinkFree does just that! It gathers all of your links into one page that is easy to navigate. Linktr.ee is a service that creates a page with a list of links that you can link to in your Instagram profile. You have to purchase the premium version to remove their branding and use your own and customize the design aesthetics more. I decided to just create my own with HTML and CSS.

This is social media reference page. You can use this in your instagram bio to showcase your other social media accounts .
